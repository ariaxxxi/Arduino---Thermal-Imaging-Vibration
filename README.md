# Arduino---Thermal-Imaging-Vibration

Ttemperature is one of the physiological indicators for assessing plants' wellbeing. Thermal imaging has been a feasible technology to detect the surface temperature for plants' stress detection. Thermal long-wave infrared (TIR) cameras (or simply thermal cameras) are calibrated sensors able to record emitted radiation in the thermal range (8–14 µm) and provide images representing temperature values per pixel. Different physical and chemical disturbances caused by pathogens affect the plant water status, which can be monitored by thermography. While this imaging techniques has been an essential tool in agriculture, it offers insights for building intimacy between humans and the plants surrounding them through the process of assessing plants' wellbeing. The designed artifact integrates a thermal camera, humidity sensor, vibration motor and LCD screen on the finger and arm. To assess and care for the plants' health, a user needs to directly touch the plants' leaves with finger. If the stress is detected, the motor will vibrate and create a feel of pain/ stress on the user's arm, thus enhancing empathy between humans and plants.
